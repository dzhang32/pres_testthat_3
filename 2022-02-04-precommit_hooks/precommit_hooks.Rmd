# What are git hooks?

- Live inside the `.git/hooks` folder
- **Customizable** scripts that run upon a certain action

# What are pre-commit hooks? 

- A developer tool for **regulation** of commits 
- Popular in python, [seeping into R](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit)

---

# A `r emo::ji("vertical_traffic_light")` for your commits

`git add` -> pre-commit `r emo::ji("vertical_traffic_light")` -> `git commit`

???

Conceptually, I like to think of them as...

---

# A `r emo::ji("vertical_traffic_light")` for your commits

`git add` -> pre-commit `r emo::ji("vertical_traffic_light")` -> `git commit`

- A set of rules (hooks) 
- Your files must pass these hooks before they are committed

???

I like to think of them as...

So why use... -> 

---

# Why use pre-commit hooks?

1. Prevent adverse commits `r emo::ji("prohibited")`
2. Ensure a consistent style or coding standard `r emo::ji("robot")`
3. Enforce consistency for collaborative projects `r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")`
4. Automate easily forgotten repetitive processes `r emo::ji("sleeping_face")`

???

Not just for those with a long-standing fear of commitment...

Broadly, from my experience, functionality falls into 4

To make this more concrete... -> 

---

# Use cases for R

- Prevent the commit of large files `r emo::ji("prohibited")`
- No `browser()` statements `r emo::ji("prohibited")`
- Styling (`stylr`) `r emo::ji("robot")` `r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")`
- linting (`lintr`) `r emo::ji("robot")` `r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")`
- Rendering `Rmd` to `md` `r emo::ji("sleeping_face")`
- Running `devtools::document()` `r emo::ji("sleeping_face")`

# Step 1 - Install pre-commit on system

Only needs to be done **once** per system
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is framework for managing pre-commit hooks
    - `pip install pre-commit`
    - `brew install pre-commit`
    - `conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit`

???

It's super easy...

# Step 2 - Create a config file

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Lives in the root of the project
- This contains details of the <span style="color:red">source of the hook</span>, <span style="color:blue">hook id</span> and <span style="color:green"> associated config</span>

---

# Step 3 - Install pre-commits

- Run `pre-commit install` inside project
- Every commit will be checked to pass your hooks
- You're done!  `r emo::ji("smile")`

???

Do a demonstration, example of pre-configured project, show commit

---

# Useful tips

- Running against all files - `pre-commit run --all-files`
- Skip pre-commit - `git commit --no-verify -m "commit message"`
- [Auto-enabling pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#automatically-enabling-pre-commit-on-repositories)

---

# Creating your own hook

- [There are several hooks available for R projects](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit)
- [Hooks have many supported languages](https://pre-commit.com/#new-hooks)
- [Simple example](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit/blob/main/inst/hooks/exported/readme-rmd-rendered.R)

---

# Alternatives and trade-offs

E.g. lintr in GHA vs pre-commit

- `pre-commit` occurs before commit
- Requirement for knowledge of `pre-commit`
- Security (use trusted sources!)
