# Overview

- What/why R packages?
- What are the best practices of developing R packages? 
- Where to release your R package

???

* I will not be covering the how in this talk
* I have tried to cram a lot in - hopefully a reference/starting point

---

# What are R packages?

- Essentially, text/image files and directories
- Units of sharing R code

---

# What differentiates scripts from R packages?

- The number of users
- The number of different ways your functions is used
- The number of different **environments** your code is executed

- Scripts (1/few) --------------> Packages (Many)

???

* Almost wanted to call this slide "The dark side of popularity...|
* The more users you have, the more problems you face!

---

# When should you make an R packages?

- Will will the code be useful to others?
- Do you want to learn? Improving the organization of your functions - e.g. mentality, documentation
- Publication - [more citations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.385211v1)

---

* There's a decision to be made - will the code be useful 
* Once you cross the learning curve, it's very low cost

---

# R package principles

1. **Reproducible** `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` 
2. **Robust** `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")` 
3. **User-friendly** `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")` 

???

* So how you protect against popularity...

---

# R package principles

1. **Reproducible** - Can you install the package? `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` 
2. **Robust** - Does your code run as expected? `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")` 
3. **User-friendly** - Is your code/UI easy to understand? `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")` 

???

- The sort of questions that you should always ask yourself as you develop the package

---

# R package components

- Dependencies `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`
- Version control `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`
- R CMD Check `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`
- Continuous integration (using GitHub actions) `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`
- Unit testing `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`
- Functions/UI design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`
- Documentation `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`
- Software design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

???

* Not exhaustive, but most important components

---

# Top-level

- <span style="color:red">Problem</span> (with scripts)
- <span style="color:green">Solution</span> (with packages)
- Principles

???

- I was deciding how best to explain this...

---

# Dependencies `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- <span style="color:red">You share/receive an R script</span>
- <span style="color:red">It doesn't run or errors</span>
- <span style="color:red">You don't have or have different installed versions of packages that the code depends on</span>

---

background-image: url("desc.png")
background-size: 500px
background-position: 50% 90%

# Dependencies `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- <span style="color:green">Add your package dependencies to your DESCRIPTION</span>

---

background-image: url("desc_ex.png")
background-size: 200px
background-position: 50% 90%

# Dependencies `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- <span style="color:green">Includes all of the packages your package needs (Imports)</span>
- <span style="color:green">And those it might need (Suggests)</span>
- <span style="color:green">Installed with `install.packages("your_package")`</span>

???

* Can also include version numbers

---

# Dependencies `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- Imports for majority of packages - all those used in your code
- Suggests for those **only** used in your examples, tests, vignettes. 
- The ~~more~~ less, the merrier

???

* Can also include version numbers

---

# Version control `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- <span style="color:red">You make a backwards incompatible change</span>
- <span style="color:red">Now you have to send your updated script to collaborators</span>
- <span style="color:red">Some people might want to use the previous version</span>

???

* This ends up very messy (e.g. script_1, script_2)
* Your new script might depend on new packages

---

background-image: url("version.png")
background-size: 600px
background-position: 30% 70%

# Version control `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- <span style="color:green">Git and GitHub</span>
- <span style="color:green">Version in DESCRIPTION</span>
- <span style="color:green">Package hosted on same location, look through commits, install from any</span>

---

# Version control `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")`

- `1.5.1` - major.minor.patch
- Major: Backwards incompatible changes
- Minor: New features/optimisations
- Patch: Bug fixes and documentation
- Bioconductor breaks this rule, `R` in general is often unique (e.g. `1.5.1.9000`)

???

* Free for public repos ~6 cores, 6 hours
* Keep it simple for now

---

# Unit testing `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- <span style="color:red">You often run tests locally and manually</span>
- <span style="color:red">This takes time and isn't comprehensive</span>
- <span style="color:red">Updated script could introduce breaking changes</span>

???

* This often is okay for simple scripts/one-liners
* But becomes a massive issue for big packages (e.g. ggplot2)
* It's difficult to predict how collaborators will use your functions

---

background-image: url("unit_tests.png")
background-size: 400px
background-position: 50% 85%

# Unit testing `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- <span style="color:green">Formalise and automate testing</span>
- <span style="color:green">Run everytime you make a change to the package, you don't have to worry!</span>

???

* If package doesn't have tests, don't be surprised but be cautious...

---

# Unit testing `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- Error fast
- The more, the merrier
- Trade-off of time taken (Bioconductor sets limits of ~10-15mins for `R CMD Check`)
- Use `testthat`

---

# R CMD Check `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- <span style="color:red">You edited your package or documentation</span>
- <span style="color:red">It now doesn't install, errors</span>
- <span style="color:red">You've already updated your Bioconductor package and users are running into problems</span>

---

background-image: url("rcmdcheck.png")
background-size: 300px
background-position: 50% 90%

# R CMD Check `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- <span style="color:green">`R CMD Check` is a command that runs **many** checks on your package</span>
- <span style="color:green">Documentation, tests, dependencies, version... etc</span>
- <span style="color:green">Makes sure you have no problems before updating</span>
- <span style="color:green">Tells you what problems you have, so you can solve them</span>

---

# R CMD Check `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- Errors, Warnings, Notes
- Run `R CMD Check` are any change to your package

---

# Continuous integration `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- <span style="color:red">You send a script, but errors occur</span>
- <span style="color:red">All dependencies seem to be matching</span>
- <span style="color:red">The person is a windows user!</span> `r emo::ji("smiling_face_with_horns")`

---

# Continuous integration `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- <span style="color:green">Use GitHub Actions (GHA) to test your package across any operating systems - FREE!</span>
- <span style="color:green">Runs `R CMD Check` and all tests</span>

???

- GHA is beyond the scope of this talk but...

---

background-image: url("gha_ex.png")
background-size: 300px
background-position: 50% 70%

# Continuous integration `r emo::ji("counterclockwise_arrows_button")` `r emo::ji("flexed_biceps")`

- GHA is getting more popular (travis/circleci are alternatives)
- Consists of a `.yml` file that sits in `package_root/.github/workflows/`
- We use it for testing but GHA is extremely flexible


???

- You could use it to automatically update a website (CRON job), or upload a docker file to docker Hub

---

# Functions/UI design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- <span style="color:red">You send a script to a collaborator</span>
- <span style="color:red">They want to to do something slightly different to your analysis</span>
- <span style="color:red">Takes them a long time to understand and modify your script</span>

???

* Sid would appreciate this...

---

background-image: url("functions.png")
background-size: 400px
background-position: 50% 70%

# Functions/UI design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- <span style="color:green">Create functions and put them inside a package</span>
- <span style="color:green">Generalizes, improves readability and flexbility</span>

???

* A bit of unfair comparison as of course, you can create functions within scripts
* But packages force you to use functions and also document them

---

# Functions/UI design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- Smaller modular functions (<~60 lines) are better 
- ^ For readability and testing
- Design for users, then optimise for performance (if needed)
- Two levels (UI vs internal)
- Names are important! 

???

- Come back to UI vs internal, worth thinking about. Simplify UI

---

# Documentation `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- <span style="color:red">You send a script to a collaborator</span>
- <span style="color:red">They don't understand what the argument `ERs_w_annotation_all_tissues_width_ab_3_no_cells_sex_specific` is supposed to be</span>

---

background-image: url("documentation.png")
background-size: 350px
background-position: 50% 70%

# Documentation `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- <span style="color:green">You create a function in your package</span>
- <span style="color:green">`R CMD Check` forces you  document it using `roxygen`</span>

---

# Documentation `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- Documentation is as important as code 
- Examples are often better than explanations
- Lot's more to document (comments inside code, data)
- Write from the perspective of the audience
- `R CMD Check` can only check that you have documentation, not that it's good. Ask friends, get feedback from users

???

* Easy to get caught up in the implementation
* For functions - why would this be useful?

---

# Software design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- Often, we come across a stage where we have a set of scripts/functions
- Create a design document 

???

* I hope that it is now more clear some of the practices you need to conform to
* But how would you design the actual system 
* This is area I am least familiar with but I think also not much out there documentation wise

---

# Software design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- OOP vs functional programming
- Design patterns
- Encapsulation - break apart your thinking into user and implementation 
- What will users need (at a minimum)? 
- It is easier to add functionality than to take it away

???

* This operates at levels function arguments, which functions to export, 

---

# Software design `r emo::ji("bellhop_bell")`

- `GenomicRanges`
- `start`, `end`, `width`
- Internally, only stores two, calculates third

???

- Cool example of encapsulation/information hiding
- Things are hidden from users

---

# Bioconductor vs CRAN vs R-universe vs GH

- Differ in terms of: 
    1. Stringency
    2. **User base**
    3. Coding/versioning standard
    4. Time-scale from submission to release

??? 

* Jumping ahead, you've created your package, now where should it go?
* Basically I would go based on user base

---

# Other tips

- Use `browser()` (for debugging)
- Maybe use `precommit hooks` (if you collaborate on a project)
- Maybe include a `docker`s (if you have external dependencies)
